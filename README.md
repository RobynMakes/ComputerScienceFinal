# ComputerScienceFinal
This will be turned in as a final project for Ms. Schwartz's Computer Science With PCE 1 & 2 class.
	
The project is based on this given prompt:

	Pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit.
	Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
	before you get one card from each suit. Then display the four cards picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice). 
	
	
This project relies heavily on two buit-in Java toolkits (Swing and AWT) for the GUI elements and basic Java logic for data handling.

Please note that there is currently an bug where one JPanel doesn't resize correctly when the play button is pressed.
If you resize the window, things will start to work again.

The runnable .jar file is in the Application folder. Please run it from there.
