# ComputerScienceFinal
This will be turned in as a final project for Ms. Schwartz's Computer Science With PCE 1 & 2 class.
	
The project is based on this given prompt:

	Pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit.
	Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
	before you get one card from each suit. Then display the four cards picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice). 
	
	
This project relies heavily on two buit-in Java toolkits (Swing and AWT) for the GUI elements and basic Java logic for data handling.
